# plugbase - tiny Portal 2 plugin base for basic projects

## Purpouse

Why does this exist? When i first got my head into the "wonderfull" world of Source Engine plugins, there weren't pretty much any resources available on the topic. This repo's goal is to eventually provide that said resource on experimentation with the Source Engine.

## Current state

As of this moment, this is a work in progress resource with the goal of having everything commented. This is the bare minimum to load into the game with `plugin_load` and report back to `plugin_status`.

As development progresses I'm planning to create more branches with ilustrations of more feature implementations to learn from.
